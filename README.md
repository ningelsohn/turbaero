# Turbaero

Simple Angular landing page of a fictional aviation company showcasing a split-flap-display in the web.

# Features

- Configurable character-set for flap-components
- Layout-builder for usage of normal chars and superscript chars
- Clickable Flaps to manually trigger them

# Issues

- Responiveness: This Project focused on designing and building a split-flap-display for the web. While the display itself is somewhat responsive (not maintaining all proportions), the layout of the landing page is not since it was just made for a simple showcase.
- Sound: I experimented with adding sound but struggled with getting acceptable performance. I am no longer working on this feature for now.
